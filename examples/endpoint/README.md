# Offr Shopify Example Endpoint

Use this template to create an endpoint to calculate pricing for your shoppers.

1. `/src/index.ts` the entry point which responds to HTTP requests
2. `/src/example.ts` provides the actual pricing calculations

## Hosting

Your HTTP endpoint can be setup however you like (any OS, any language, etc).
However, since you already need JavaScript for your shopper's browser
experience, we'll stick with that language and build our example for Deno
Deploy.
